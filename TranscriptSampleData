106335	2017-01-04 15:40:41.000	Good morning. My name is Kalia and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ford Monthly Sales Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.   I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Erich Merkle, U.S. sales analyst. Please go ahead.
106335	2017-01-04 15:40:41.000	Thank you, Kalia, and welcome, everyone, to Ford's December 2016 U.S. Sales Call. Good morning. Today, we're joined by Mark LaNeve, Ford Vice President of U.S. Marketing, Sales and Service; and also, Emily Kolinski Morris, Ford's Chief Economist. So with that, we're going to kick things off here. And first up, we're going to get industry and Ford perspective here from Mark. Mark?
106335	2017-01-04 15:40:41.000	Thank you, Erich, and Happy New Year to everyone out there. First, let's take a look at December, then I'll transition into a couple of full year comments and data points.   We believe the industry followed up a strong November with a strong month of December, based on what we're seeing in this morning's early data. Our data would suggest that total sales, including medium and heavy trucks, came in at about 1.69 million vehicles in December. That would be a slight overall increase of 1% versus a year ago.   The corresponding total industry SAAR would be in the low to mid-18 million vehicle range for the month. December's retail performance was also up approximately 1%, with retail sales estimated at about 1.35 million to 1.37 million vehicles.   And we did see higher industry incentive spend of $530 per unit relative to December 2015, and a corresponding ATP increase as well. For the year, this will place the industry, based on what we know, at about 17.8 million total vehicles, which was our previous guidance for the full year '16, and that's very consistent with year-ago levels, and I might add, a very healthy pace for the industry.   Ford -- moving on to Ford. Our overall sales for December totaled 239,854 vehicles, which was a slight increase of 0.3% compared to December of 2015. Within those numbers on the retail side, business was strong, up 5% year-over-year on a retail basis, making it our best December in 12 years.   Fleet sales were down 13% for the month, which is consistent with our plan as we've discussed all year of having daily rental fleets that were front-loaded in 2016, with a back half -- with a decline in the back half of the year. Importantly, these results were achieved with Ford's overall transaction pricing in December increasing by $1,400 compared to December of 2015. This was the largest increase of any major automaker in December. It outperformed the industry, which is up $530, as I mentioned, year-over-year. So we had an increase of almost triple the industry average.   The gains were impacted by our strong Super Duty pricing, as that new vehicle continues to perform exceptionally well in the market, with transaction pricing on the new Super Duty up $5,400 over year-ago levels at $55,100 per truck.  A rich mix of the all-new Super Duty pickup continues to be in high demand, with 65% of retail sales being made up of our Lariat, King Ranch and Platinum edition trucks. Overall F-Series transaction pricing totaled $44,700 per truck, which is up $1,700 versus a year ago, and a new record for F-Series average transaction pricing.   Let's dig in a little more on truck performance specifically for December. F-Series sales totaled 87,512 trucks last month, a 3% increase and our best monthly sales performance since December of '05. This was achieved through strong retail performance for both F-150 and the all-new Super Duty.   F-150 sales were up 3% at retail while retail sales of the all-new Super Duty increased 24% for the month. Super Duty increased in every region in the country in December. Sales were up 19% in the Northeast, 33% in the Southeast, 32% in the West, 18% here in the Great Lakes and 23% in the largest pickup market in the country, the one most impacted, obviously, by the oil economy, the Central region.   December marks our 10th best month ever in F-Series history, and we couldn't be more pleased with both our new F-150, it's been out in the market now for well over a full year, and the all new Super Duty performance.   Vans were another great story, continue to perform remarkably well as sales totaled 22,302 in December, providing a 3% increase and making it a record Ford commercial van sales month. Within that -- within the van number, we talk commercial quite a bit. On the retail side, Transit retail performance was up 61% for December, showing increased acceptance of Transit as a personal use people mover, which is very encouraging, up 61% on a retail basis.   We also closed out the year with strong performance with our SUVs in December. Ford brand SUVs had their best December since 2002 with 68,685 SUVs sold, a 5% increase versus a year ago. Edge totaled 12,691 last month, an increase of 24%. Explorer delivered a strong month with 19,030 vehicles sold, making it Explorer's best December performance since 2004. And Expedition increased 30% last month with 5,259 vehicles sold.   So that's a look at December. Strong month for Ford, looks like a strong month for the industry. Let's take a look at some full year highlights. For Ford, our total 2016 U.S. sales were 2,614,697 vehicles. That marked our best total sales performance in a decade. Within that number, on a Ford brand basis only, we sold 2,502,973 vehicles, making Ford America's best-selling brand for the seventh straight year.   F-Series continued its leadership as America's best-selling truck for 40 straight years and America's best-selling of any kind of vehicle for 35 years. We sold 82,800 F-Series -- excuse me, 820,800 F-Series in 2016. That's up 5% retail, 5% total. And of course, any time you get over 800,000, that's somewhat of a magical number for us. And we're very proud of the effort that the entire team, including our dealers, put forth to get that number for us.   Not only did F-Series grow by 5% last year, we also outsold our nearest competitor, so #2, by 245,000 units in 2016. In fact, it appears we grew our lead from last year by 66,000 trucks compared to #2 competitor, which of course, is Silverado.   Van sales totaled 240,600 for the year, representing a 9% increase, making Ford America's best-selling commercial van for 38 straight years. F-Series, vans and heavy trucks together totaled 1,077,000 vehicles for 2016, that's a 7% increase, and makes Ford America's best-selling truck brand for the year.   Ford brand SUVs had their best annual sales performance since the record results of 2001. Ford brand SUVs totaled 772,667 vehicles last year, with record-setting performance from both Escape and Edge. And of course, Explorer continues to dominate its segment as well.   Moving on to Lincoln. Lincoln also had a great December, posting an 18% gain with 12,791 vehicles sold. Lincoln car sales were up 28%, with a strong performance from the all-new Continental. Continental sales totaled 1,845 vehicles in December, its best sales month since its launch.   MKX had another stellar month, up 19%. And MKX, along with MKZ, helped expand Lincoln's overall SUV sales by 13% in December. For the year, Lincoln sales totaled 111,724, establishing Lincoln's best annual performance in 9 years dating back to 2007, and that was against the backdrop of a flat overall luxury segment. So we're enthusiastic about the opportunities in store for the Lincoln brand this year and excited to share our story throughout 2017.   So that's a look at '16 and the month of December. We're looking forward to another great year. Obviously, it was a strong year for the industry.   And with that, I'll turn it over to Emily for an update on the economic front.
106335	2017-01-04 15:40:41.000	Great. Thanks, Mark. And welcome, everyone, to 2017. Let me add an economic perspective to the host of year-end assessments circulating in this first week of the new year. While the data for 2016 are not yet complete, I think we can say with some confidence that the recovery that began back in 2009 remained on solid footing in the year just ended.   Consumer confidence averaged 91.8 for the year, about 5 points above its long-run average. Job gains averaged 180,000 per month and housing starts were up 5.4%, both series through November. And GDP growth averaged 1.5% on a year-over-year basis through the first 3 quarters of 2016.   In terms of the more recent monthly data for December, we've seen renewed strength in consumer and manufacturing sentiment, continued improvement in labor market conditions, based on weekly jobless claims, and a bit of a shift in the trajectory for interest rates, particularly at the long end of the curve.   To note some details, the December reading of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index rose 4.4 points, edging past the January 2015 peak to reach a 12-year high of 98.2. Respondents' views largely influenced by improved current income assessments, as well as a more favorable outlook for the economy in the year ahead, while forward-looking income expectations were slightly lower than in the prior year. The share of survey respondents who reported that it was a good time to buy a car also fell by 2 percentage points to 65%, influenced by responses concerning higher interest rates.   Through November, the labor market continued to provide support for households, as non-farm employment rose by 178,000, only slightly below the year-to-date average gain of 180,000. The unemployment rate in November fell 0.3 percentage point from the prior month to 4.6%. And average hourly earnings rose 2.5% from the prior year, in line with their year-to-date average gain.   New claims for unemployment insurance show that labor market strength extended into December. During the week ended December 24, there were 265,000 new claims for unemployment insurance, with the 4-week moving average at 263,000, representing a sustained run rate last achieved 4 decades ago.   The housing sector has been demonstrating some volatility in the month-to-month data as November new housing starts fell by 18.7% from October after an unexpected 25.5% gain in the prior month. Looking past the volatility at the year through November, growth in starts of 5.4%, as I mentioned at the outset, suggests the continuation of the ongoing steady recovery in this sector. The nearly 13% increase in the sale of new homes for the year-to-date is also suggestive of support for the housing market.   As for manufacturing, the December PMI rose 1.5 percentage points to 54.7%, led by substantial increases in new orders and production. Also of note, the prices index component registered 65.5% in December, an increase of 11 percentage points from November and the 10th month above 50 for this index component, indicating higher raw material prices for manufacturers alongside improving business conditions.   Against this backdrop of 2016 data, the Federal Reserve increased its federal funds rate by 25 basis points in December, marking the second such increase of this tightening cycle. But perhaps even more noteworthy is the increase in longer-term interest rates since November, with the yield on 10-year treasury bonds up about 60 basis points over the past 2 months.   As we've noticed -- noted previously, we expect interest rates should generally be consistent with the broader economic environment. And as such, the recent rate increases are consistent with a favorable outlook for growth, along with some pickup in overall inflation, as commodity prices and wage growth have firmed modestly.   As we mentioned earlier, we see the December SAAR approaching a low to mid-18 million unit range, putting the full year industry about in line with our previous guidance of 17.8 million. Our guidance for 2017 is unchanged at 17.7 million units, and that includes medium and heavy trucks. And that will be supported by an economy projected to average 2.2% growth in this coming year.   So with that summary, let me turn it over to Erich for some additional comments.
106335	2017-01-04 15:40:41.000	Thank you, Emily. And I'm just going to take a look at a few industry segment trends that we saw in the month of December. If we take a look at -- we had another strong showing from small SUVs. They represented about 20% of the industry last month. And that was up about 1 point higher than a year ago. And it's pretty consistent at this point, with the segment operating around the 20% level for much of the year.   We estimate that midsize cars represented approximately 10% of the industry last month, which is about a 2-point drop from a year ago. And the sequential decline was about 1 point compared to November.   Full-size pickups, pretty consistent. We're looking at about 13.6% of industry in December. And this is, like I say, very consistent with a year ago and also very consistent with November.   So taking a look at a few of the housekeeping items. We're going to take a look here at our fleet as a percentage of our total sales. And we'll start out with the month of December. If we take a look at the month of December, fleet as a percentage of our total sales was 24%. The breakout on that is 12% for commercial, 6% for government and 6% for daily rental. If we compare this to December of 2015, our fleet as a percentage of our total sales was 27%. And the breakout for that is 12% for commercial, 6% for government and 9% for daily rental.   Taking a look for the full year of 2016. Fleet as a percentage of our total sales is 29%. That's 12% for commercial, 6% for government and 11% for daily rental. Comparing this to year ago, December 2015, the previous year, fleet as a percentage of our total sales was 28%. And that breaks out for commercial at 12%, government at 5% and daily rental at 11%. So you'll notice that the daily rental component is very consistent with year ago, just as we've been stating for -- just as we've been on -- just as we planned for the year.   Taking a look at gross vehicle inventory or gross stock for the month of December 2016. We had 156,000 cars in gross inventory. Trucks were at 304,000, utilities or SUVs at 187,000, giving us a total of 647,000 vehicles. And that translated into 70 days supply. Taking a look at November 2016, the previous month. We had 155,000 cars in inventory, 306,000 trucks, 193,000 SUVs, giving us a total of 654,000 vehicles, and that translated into 83 days supply. Comparing it to December of last -- or December of 2015, gross stock for cars was at 195,000, trucks were at 305,000, SUVs at 174,000, giving us a total of 674,000 vehicles, translating into 73 days supply. So we really end the year here at 70 days supply and a very good position from an inventory perspective as we go into next year.   With that, with all the housekeeping items taken care of, Kalia, we're going to move things over for questions. And we're going to start with the analyst community, please.
106335	2017-01-04 15:40:41.000	[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.
106335	2017-01-04 15:40:41.000	Just 2 quick questions for you. First, Erich, I wonder if you could just give us lease levels for Ford and what you saw in the industry either in December or recently in the fourth quarter. And then secondly, as you think about the market shifting away from small cars and your announcement not to go ahead with the plant in Mexico, just curious how you feel about supply of small cars relative to demand within Ford. And do you think that small crossovers are really going to really take over for these small cars and really replace that segment of the market over time?
106335	2017-01-04 15:40:41.000	John, I didn't catch the first part of your question. Could you rephrase it, repeat that if you could?
106335	2017-01-04 15:40:41.000	I'm sorry. Just wondering if you could talk about lease levels, the lease penetration for Ford in December. What you think it was for the industry or what you're seeing more recently in the fourth quarter?
106335	2017-01-04 15:40:41.000	Yes. Well, we've been seeing -- okay, yes, we're at about 21%, and the industry is running a little bit higher than that. Although it has come down as we've gotten in towards the end of the year. So we've been very mindful of that. We've been managing that process very carefully. But yes, we're right around 21% and that has come down throughout the year along with the industry.
106335	2017-01-04 15:40:41.000	Then in terms -- yes, John, in terms of small cars. We have our inventory really across the board ending the year at 70 [ph] we took inventory -- the gross number stock actually down over the course of the year as well from January to December. You've got -- across our entire lineup, we got of couple like flex, we tend to run because of the low volume will tend to run somewhat higher days supply on occasion adequate stock but really, we're which shape and stock basis on all of our top 7 or 8 volume products that represent 85%, 90% of our overall retail volume. So we feel we're in really good position moving into the beginning of the year.
106335	2017-01-04 15:40:41.000	Yes. And if I could just add to that. John, if you take a look at our car, gross stock inventory in December, as I just mentioned, 156,000 and that compares to 195,000 a year ago. So certainly, we've adjusted to the lowering demand -- the waning demand of cars in the marketplace as more people have rotated into SUVs.
106335	2017-01-04 15:40:41.000	[Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of Bryan Johnson of Barclays.
106335	2017-01-04 15:40:41.000	This is Dan Levy on for Bryan. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to follow-up on a question on small mid-sedans. In December, we actually saw an interesting data point that car pricing was actually better. I think small car -- the mid-month small car ATPs were up 4 [ph] -- a small car ATPs were up 4%, mid-car ATPs were up 1%. And that's really just breaking from the pricing pressure we'd seen for quite some time in this segment. I know that the outlook for car pricing is still of a pressure to persist. But I'm wondering if this should be viewed as an anomaly do you think this could be a sign that the magnitude of pricing pressure in the car segment might actually be coming down just because it's been so difficult for so long already?
